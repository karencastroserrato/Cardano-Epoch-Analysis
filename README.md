# About this project

#### Epoch
Cardano is a blockchain for executing smart contracts and additionally creates its own digital currency known as Ada. It is an open source network. That network is divided by periods of time to what is known as epoch. An epoch has a duration of 5 days.

#### Slots
In turn, an epoch is divided into slots, that is, there are 432,000 slots in an epoch. One second represents one slot and every 20 min a block can be generated or assigned to a block operator.

#### Delegation
Now, delegation means that a holder of the Ada-Cardano cryptocurrency can participate in the creation of blocks with their coins and receive rewards from it.

#### Staking
Staking is the cardano model that helps to monetize and maintain your tokens. It also promotes keeping its validators on the blockchain.

### Analysis :green_heart:
This project consists of generating an analysis of the data collected in each Cardano epoch elapsed in the year 2021. The data analyzed are those obtained on the day that occurs in the epoch and arbitrarily selected those that occur three hours before the epoch and three hours after the epoch.

The main objective of the project was to calculate what is the best time to buy adas and what is the best time to sell adas taking into account the profit margin.

Initially, a combination was made one by one between all the times (or positions) to determine in which combination the highest profit was obtained. Then, proceeded to weigh all the profits that occurred in the same combination of positions. Finally, the best profits were plotted along with their respective position and a small pattern could be observed in the behavior of the graphs one hour before and one hour after each epoch.
